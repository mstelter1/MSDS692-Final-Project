# MSDS692-Final-Project
Online presence for MSDS 692 Final Project, Automated Rail Inclusion Application

Desciptions of included files:

RailUT.ipynb
  This is the notebook code for the main application. This notebook connects to data servers, runs SQL queries, gathers the data, cleans the data, and exports the data to a central excel workbook for use in PowerBI Visualizations. The connections to the data serves and the path for the excel workbook were removed for confidentiality reasons. This code will not run; it is only to show and descibe how the application works.

GUI.ipynb
  This is the notebook code for the GUI interaction used in the application. It references and executes .Py version of the previously described file. Once the file is executed, the window automatically closes.
  
PowerBI Dashboard
  The final build to visualize the data collected and display in graphs.
  
DataCopy.xlsx
  A dummy version of the collected data, for use with the PowerBI Dashboard. Allows user to view graphs and the established connections/interactions. The file is data that was randomly generated, and does not represent accurate data collection. The real process data was removed for confidentiality reasons.
